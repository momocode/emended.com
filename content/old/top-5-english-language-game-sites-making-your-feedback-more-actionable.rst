To spare you searching all the wrong sites for just the right games,
here are our top 5 English-language game sites, with thousands of free
games amongst them to share with students:

1. `ESL Games World <http://www.eslgamesworld.com/>`__

ESL Games World shines in its categorisation of games and then allowing
for the learning-level of users to be a point of orientation. By
clicking around the colourful toolbar atop the site, you can navigate
the site like a pro even if it’s your first time visiting. The spelling
and grammar games they have on offer are well-conceived, uniquely fun,
and recurringly inspired by pop culture so for students, there will be
an inbuilt familiarity right from the get-go.

2. `Merriam-Webster’s Word Games &
Quizzes <https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-games>`__

Housed under Word Games & Quizzes, the American powerhouse of
Merriam-Webster offers a one-stop literacy shop for all the classics.
The content provided is more suited for the adult ESL learner but is
sure to bring out the kid in any user with ventures into cryptogram
cracking, logic puzzles, and even hidden-word reveals. The games are
top-notch in make and probably the fastest as far as loading times go of
our top 5. Enjoy!

3. `British Council’s LearnEnglish
Kids <http://learnenglishkids.britishcouncil.org/en/fun-games>`__

Another masterfully organised site, British Council’s LearnEnglish Kids
has a welcoming toolbar and wins our top 5’s most beautiful design and
feel. The games are well made and deal with more or less conventional
areas of speaking, spelling, and grammar. A pleasant spin throughout the
British Council’s répertoire of games, jokes, and interactive tongue
twisters is their infusion of positive messages and tones, with bullying
prevention and a healthy self-image on the docket, to name a couple.

4. `Vocabulary.co.il <https://www.vocabulary.co.il/>`__

Vkidz’ Vocabulary.co.il has a lot on offer for English-language learners
and its variety makes it a standout in the educational e-games field.
The site’s platter ranges from wordplays and the quizzable idiomatic to
more general word-building and, of course, the adventuresome
story-based. If you’re looking for a particular game type or topic, the
site hosts its own search engine with which to find it and also has an
easy-to-see layout of what games are related to the one currently being
played, which is fun if you’ve got students who like to jump around a
bit.

5. `JeopardyLabs <https://jeopardylabs.com/>`__

The power of JeopardyLabs lies in its flexibly open-ended approach to
educational gaming. The idea is simple – offer language-instrumental
quizzes in the style of Jeopardy!, the wildly popular knowledge-checking
game show. The site does an outstanding job at emulating the game show’s
platform (down to even the authentic yellow-on-blue board!) and true to
our own top-5 criteria here is the site’s personal motto of no fees, no
registration. While you can indeed devise Jeopardy games for students in
support of what’s being taught in your own classes, there are actually
hundreds of already-made JeopardyLabs games ready to go. With this site
in your toolbox, the ability constructively to challenge students of all
ages and levels (and on any topic!) is quite simply, yours.
